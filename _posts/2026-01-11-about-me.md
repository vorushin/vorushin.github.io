![Roman and Robert](/img/intro/roman.jpg)

My name is Roman Vorushin. I am a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), working on Gemini.

I fell in love with ML and AI back in 2011, thanks to the legendary MOOCs ai-class.org (Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun) and ml-class.org (Andrew Ng). Before Google I was an early Grammarly employee, had my own startup, and worked in Kazkommertsbank.

I used to have a technical blog in Russian ([archived here](/ru/)). Now I am writing longer technical articles about LLM training and artificial intelligence in English.
